`bojler-skeleton` is a starter template for your [bojler](http://bojler.slicejack.com) projects.

By default, [bojler](http://bojler.slicejack.com) consists of distribution and source `.scss` files. If you want to use [bojler](http://bojler.slicejack.com) on your own project you are able to include its distribution files directly to your email templates or you can transpile `.scss` files by yourself.

To make it easier for you to start a new project with [bojler](http://bojler.slicejack.com) we've created `bojler-skeleton`. It is a simple starter template which has everything you need to start your project very quickly.

In section below you'll find everything you need to get started with `bojler-skeleton`.

## Getting started üöÄ
### 1. [Download](https://github.com/Slicejack/bojler-skeleton/archive/v1.1.0.zip) ‚Äî `v1.1.0`

Download `bojler-skeleton` source files [here](https://github.com/Slicejack/bojler-skeleton/archive/v1.1.0.zip).

### 2. Install Node Packages ‚Äî `npm install`
Secondly, install node packages in root of your newly downloaded folder with `npm install` command.

> [This is an example](https://asciinema.org/a/J505xs1KCUxFaL1PpMtDacpOf) of what you should get after you run `npm install` command.

### 3. Start Development Server With LiveReload
Let's fire up our development server üî•

Run `npm run dev` in your project root folder.

> [This is an example](https://asciinema.org/a/Sl0UAzRRM7jALm0aEMJcPB9K2) of what you should get after you run `npm run dev` command and save some changes while your development server is running.

While your development server is running, every time you make and save changes they will be automatically compiled to your `dist/` folder.

### 4. Build Templates
Now you can start adding custom `.html` and `.scss` files inside `src/` folder.

Make sure every `.scss` partial that needs to be inlined end up in your `src/scss/inline.scss` file.

Same goes for partials that needs to be embedded in your `<head>`, make sure they end up in `src/scss/embed.scss`.

### 5. Use your emails üèÅ üéâ
Finally, distribution files will be available in `dist/` folder.

`embed.scss` will be embedded in the `<head>` and `inline.scss` will be inlined in HTML markup of your email template.

Emails will be freshly compiled and will wait for you every time you run `npm run build` or `npm run dev` command.
